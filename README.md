# Samuels Portfolio

## Description

For this assignment i was tasked with creating a portfolio to show off my previous work to potential employers. While creating this project I made sure to include an about me section which included a recent photo, a section showcasing different projects i've completed, and a section containing various contact methods i can be reached at. I also made sure the links in the navigation bar corresponded to the correct section in order to ensure ease of access.
 
Through this project I was able to better familiarize myself with advanced CSS styling that I can now use on future projects.
